# Oral-Cancer-Detection

Background: ML Pipeline to standardise the process of building and analysing ML models to allowing biomedical imaging researchers to focus on domain-specific tasks rather than dealing with complex data pre/pro-processing. Biomedical Imaging Researchers should be able to tweak hyperparameters of ML models based on accuracy of results
